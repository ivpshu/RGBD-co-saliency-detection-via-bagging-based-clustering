How to use:

1. Run cul_single_sal.m to get single RGBD map and region features.

2. Then, run demo.m to calculate RGBD co-sal maps.

Note: 
% this version of the code is mainly for testing (may be with chinese comments in some m files), formal version of the code will be released soon.
% The ucm data for region pre-seg can be obtained using code in "ucm_code_linux" for linux.(The full ucm files for RGBD_CoSeg_Dataset are given in the code)
